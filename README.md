# Campfire
## Campfire is a 2D Unity based game written using C# and SQLite to manage a local database.
### The game is a about a hiker that runs around and collects logs in order to keep his fire going. As time passes, the fire goes out faster and requires to move faster. At some point the player loses and is asked to insert his name. The name and score is stored in that database. If the name is already present, the score is set to the highscore.
### I made this project a few years back and lost the original files, having acces only to the built version which is present in the .rar attached where you can download and play it. There also is a documentation attached where you can still see pieces of code and how the scenes looked in the game engine.
